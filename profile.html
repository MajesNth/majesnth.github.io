            <h2>Extra-curricular activities</h2>
            <p>I do not have concrete plans to work alongside my studies but I am considering, if possible, working in software engineering alongside my studies. In my spare time I like to play video games competitively with friends, watch movies, series,
                anime and entertaining as well as informational videos. Watching informational videos to topics related to my study can help me learn better and is often something I do when encountering a topic I do not understand well enough and if I
                am able to, working in the same field that I study can help me deepen the knowledge I have obtained as I use it in practice and in an environment outside of school. Otherwise, trying to create small programs can also be a fun leisure activity
                to apply what I have learned and is something that I have done in the past but only at a very small scale. As for the other hobbies, they help to create a relaxing balance within my free time and possibly improve collaboration skills,
                as I often do not play alone.</p>
