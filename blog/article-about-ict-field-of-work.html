        <h1>Article about my future in the ICT field of work</h1>
        <h2><em>What do I see from my future in the ICT world?</em></h2>
        <p>I want to work probably in the Netherlands after completing my study and work in as a general software engineer in back-end development because it's the part that I enjoy the most: writing down the logical steps that the program goes through and
            understanding it is more fun and interesting to me. </br>
            </br>I want to work in a larger-sized company because they generally pay better than the smaller ones and I think it is a good experience to have professionally - it sets a better impression for future jobs when having worked for a big, well-known
            company than a smaller one. </br>
            </br>After having worked for a few years, gathering good experience and deepening my knowledge of the field, I will have a better idea of what I would like to specialize on and by then, I will probably want to get a Master's degree as I will have
            a better idea of if I still want to do it and what exactly I want to have it on. </br>
            </br>After the Master's degree and some work experience, I should be able to apply for better positions and earn more.</p>
