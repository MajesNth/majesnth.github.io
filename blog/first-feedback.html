        <h1>My first feedback</h1>
        <p>I joined the program a bit late, so my first feedback also happened quite late. This was the feedback on my PCO website already, by Frans Blauw. I showed him my website on my computer and he gave me a lot of constructive feedback about it. </p>

        <h2>The feedback</h2>
        <p>He said my website had a consistent look, but needs maybe some branding like a logo or name across all the pages, the home page as well. The font was still unchanged so he said I should try out different fonts to see what works. He said he really
            like the background color and that the main block text color contrasted well enough, however the heading color did not, as the background was a dark blue and the heading was a strong orange-red color that was not light enough. He explained
            to me that I don't need to apply all of the feedback I receive, I just need to say why I did or did not apply it. He told me to think about the order of reading of the pages, and centralize the text, because it covered the entire width of
            the page, which wasn't inviting for reading, it should look more like a portrait than a landscape, so it should have a margin to be displayed vertically.
            </br>
            </br>
            He looked at the dashboard which was filled with the first year courses as the specifications specified, but for my case, because I'm doing the second year courses already, he said that I should replace it with those instead and only include PCO from
            the first year since I'm doing that as well.
            </br>
            </br>
            All in all, he said the content that needs to be there is there, which was good.
            </br>
            </br>
            Looking at the visual, he said branding helps a lot and that the primary color can be in the logo, and if I want to bring my website to the next level, I should focus on colors, so I needed to look up how to really pick good colors and experiment with
            different fonts. He said I could add more images and colors to make the side look better, maybe add a header image for every page.
        </p>
        <h2>My thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            Overall I felt good when I heard the feedback because I felt like it was still missing a lot, but it turns out it had most of what it needs. I was aware that colors needed work but he gave me good advice on how to fix the glaring issues. I was just trying
            a new color scheme and was thinking of changing it entirely but since he liked the background color a lot, I decided to keep it because I like it too, so I just needed to change the colors of the fonts. For the text margins, I wasn't really
            aware but overall that was an easy fix, and I had forgotten about changing the font color so I will now focus a bit on that as well, along with the branding. I also got to ask him questions about things I wasn't sure about like the remaining
            feedback I needed and the remaining blog pages' contents that I needed to fill in.</p>
