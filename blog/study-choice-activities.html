    <h1>My Study Choice Activities!</h1>
    <h2>STUDY CHOICE ACTIVITIES</h2>
    <h3><em>What initiatives did you take to make your study choice?</em></h3>
    <p>To make my study choice, I searched for a lot of information about the different programs I could be interested in and I asked my family advice on where to look or what to look for. </br>
        </br> The best education programs are usually abroad, so in North America, Europe or Asia. I ended up coming to the Netherlands specifically initially because my sister was already studying there; it was cheaper to study in than most universities some
        countries such as the United Kingdom and United States; and I had actually gotten accepted here. </br>
        </br> Overall it seemed like one of the better choices. That was for my first time in the Netherlands, and later on it was an even easier choice to make, after having studied here in the past.</p>

    <h2>MOTIVATE YOUR STUDY CHOICE</h2>
    <h3><em>Why did you choose this study programme? Explain your choice in at least 3 sentences.</em></h3>
    <p>Then, for the choice of the program itself, during High School, I had already gotten advice from my teachers that I should do something related to engineering based on my prime subjects: Math and sciences. Therefore I looked at what the different
        types of engineering out there are and I found Mechanical, Civil, Electrical, Software, Biomedical, Aerospace and Industrial Engineering. </br>
        </br> Out of all of the programs, and looking at what they consist of, the one that was most appealing was without a doubt software engineering. </br> I think that it is the most interesting to learn because it has the best and broadest applications:
        with software engineering, I can literally make an application of something I think I need in my life that makes it easier, while the other ones feel rather limited to its field; I'm not gonna go home and start doing some civil engineering the
        same way I would be able to with software. </br>
        </br> Perhaps Electrical engineering shares those same advantages, however, I like to spend a lot of time on computers, mostly playing video games, and at the time, I thought that I could maybe do Game Develomment but didn't want to fully dive into
        it because I wasn't sure how my parents would react, and I also wasn't sure whether I actually wanted to go with it, so going for software engineering was the perfect middle ground that still allowed me to go for it later if I wanted to, or go
        into a broader field if I decide to do something else.
    </p>

    <h2>AFTER COMPLETING THE STUDY...</h2>
    <h3><em>What do you want to do after graduating? What profession or position are you interested in? Why?</em></h3>
    <p>Nowadays, I think of my future in the field and I want to eventually go back to my home country and work from there and I don't know of any companies that are developping games from Rwanda, so I think software engineering is a better choice for that.
        </br>
        Also, I have already started a program of Software engineering and have seen what we learn and what we do, and I like it a lot, especially the back-end because it feels like the most important part. </br>
        </br> I like developping the logical part of it, the same way I liked solving math equations much better than I like creating a good visual, for instance and I don't mind sitting behind typing on a screen all-day; I already do that a lot, and I see
        the potential in applying what I have learned to make my personal life easier as well. </br>
        </br> All in all, I really think that this is the best program for me to learn.
