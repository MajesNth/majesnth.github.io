        <p>I have done a previous study in Software Engineering study for 3 years, though I did not complete it. During that time, I have studied and used mainly Java from the beginning, it was the first language I learned to use and my most comfortable
            one to use. </br>
            We mainly learned Object Oriented Programming at the beginning. However, I have also had experience with other languages in various projects, namely: Python, php, c++ again for object oriented programming, c for programming with an unmanaged programming
            language to get used to pointers or allocating memory, Javascript for functional programming, Prolog for logical programming and SQL to work with databases. </br>In the end, I am somewhat familiar with these languages but need
            some time to adjust when working with them again as I did not work on them as extensively as I did with Java.
